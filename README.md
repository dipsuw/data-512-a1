## Data Curation
* Data curation is the management of data throughout its lifecycle, from creation and initial storage to the time when it is archived or becomes obsolete and is deleted. As a part of data curation we would construct, analyze, and publish a dataset of monthly traffic on English Wikipedia from July 1 2008 through September 30 2017.
## List the license of the source data and a link to the Wikimedia Foundation terms of use (LINK)
* MIT License:  This is the simplest license of all. Please feel free to use the code as and when needed. 
## Link to all relevant API documentation
* The legacy Pagecounts API (documentation, endpoint) provides access to desktop and mobile traffic data from January 2008 through July 2016.
* The Pageviews API (documentation, endpoint) provides access to desktop, mobile web, and mobile app traffic data from July 2015 through September 2017.
## Describe the values of all fields in your final data file.
## List any known issues or special considerations with the data that would be useful for another researcher to know. 
* Pageview API excludes spiders/crawlers, while data from the Pagecounts API does not.
